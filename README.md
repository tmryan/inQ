# inQ
inQ is a simple game engine project that I decided to create over the 2016 summer break. I am passionate about games as well as solving problems and, fortunately for me, game engines involve lots of both! So, this is the start of something awesome and I look forward to learning as much as I can.

####Latest Update:
Now that the fall semester has started, I need to refocus my efforts on school instead of this project. Below are some things I would like to get implemented in the future, but all timeframes are purely conjecture.

####inQ_Test:
I've added a zipped folder with inQ_Test.jar and all the required image files. There isn't any UI yet, the movement doesn't feel great, and the FPS is lower than I would like, but feel free to check it out [HERE](inQ_Test.zip)! Just download the zipped folder, extract, and double-click on inQ_Test.jar to launch the program. Right now it consists of a simple test of the systems I have implemented so far. In the future I will expand it to include a UI layer and other features.

Press the 'A' key to walk left, 'S' to walk right, and the spacebar to jump.

###ToDo
######Timeframe: hopefully I will find some time during school for these
- Fix movement; especially jumping and jump/move
- Clean up and document code
- Finish interactive actor implementation
- Highlight chest if player nearby
- Implement double jump

###Next Steps
######Timeframe: possibly during the winter break
- Implement UI layer
- Move debug components to UI
- Build editor (for pathing and actor placement initially)
- Fix game loop
- Combine animation frames onto one image (i.e. sprite sheets,texture atlas,...)
- See if there are any easily redesigned systems, or new systems
- Clean up and document code...

###Fun Stuff
######Timeframe: no time soon
- Implement scene tiling
- Implement game space to gfx space ratio
- Implement full screen and resizable window
- Migrate graphics to OpenGL; might be cool to implement in C++ and play around with running through Java
- Add time and weather systems
- Add audio systems; research good lib
- Figure out how to implement event scripting functionality
- Implement AI 
- Play with skills, items and combat systems implementation
- Find better design for mover and collision systems
- Build a more robust editor for fun
- Also, clean up and document code
