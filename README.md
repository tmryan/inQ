# inQ
Simple game engine project

inQ is a simple game engine project that I decided to create over the 2016 summer break. I am passionate about games as well as solving problems and, fortunately for me, game engines involve lots of both! So, this is the start of something beautiful and I look forward to learning as much as I can.

(I'll update this repository with a TODO list ASAP)
