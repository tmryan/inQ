# inQ
inQ is a simple game engine project that I decided to create over the 2016 summer break. I am passionate about games as well as solving problems and, fortunately for me, game engines involve lots of both! So, this is the start of something awesome and I look forward to learning as much as I can.

Now that the fall semester has started, I need to refocus my efforts on school instead of this project. Below are some things I would like to get implemented in the future, but all timeframes are purely conjecture.

###ToDo
######Timeframe: hopefully I will find some time during school for these
- Finish interactive actor implementation
- Place fadeable occlusion actor over area with chest inside
- Highlight chest if player nearby
- Clean up and document code

###Next Steps
######Timeframe: possibly during the winter break
- Implement UI layer
- Move debug components to UI
- Build editor (for pathing and actor placement initially)
- Fix game loop
- Combine animation frames onto one image (i.e. sprite sheets,texture atlas,...)
- See if there are any easily redesigned systems, or new systems

###Fun Stuff
######Timeframe: no time soon
- Implement scene tiling
- Implement game space to gfx space ratio
- Implement full screen and resizable window
- Migrate graphics to OpenGL; might be cool to implement in C++ and play around with running through Java
- Add time and weather systems
- Add audio systems; research good lib
- Figure out how to implement event scripting functionality
- Implement AI 
- Play with skills, items and combat systems implementation
- Find better design for mover and collision systems
- Build a more robust editor for fun
